"# california_housing_price_prediction" 

#### Introduction
In this lab, you'll create and measure the relative performances of Random Forest and XGBoost regression models for predicting house prices using the California Housing Dataset.
'Performance' means both speed and accuracy.

#### Objective
- Use scikit-learn to implement Random Forest and XGBoost regression models
- Compare the performances of the two models

#### Flow
- Import libraries
- Understand data
- Split into training and test data
- Train random forest and XGBoost
- Performance check (training speed and prediction accuracy)
- Model Visualization
